# KaiLanguage
The Kai Programming Language, trying to have the smallest keywords of any language.

File Extention: `.kai`

## The Plan
The plan is simple, create a language that takes as few characters to produce a keyword. At some point to take those keywords and make them symbols, then gradually make them smaller until they are as small as possible per file.

## The Tech
Everything will be made in Crystal (originally was in C++ but no longer due to some issues)

## The Reasons
I want to see how small I can make programs in terms of bytes.
